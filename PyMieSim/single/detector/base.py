    def get_coupling(self, scatterer: BaseScatterer) -> Power:
        r"""
        Compute the light coupling between the detector and a scatterer.

        The coupling quantifies the interaction between the field captured by the detector and the scattered field produced by the scatterer. Mathematically, the coupling is calculated as:

        .. math::
            |\iint_{\Omega}  \Phi_{det} \, \Psi_{scat}^* \,  d \Omega|^2

        Where:

        - \( \Phi_{det} \): The capturing field of the detector, representing the sensitivity of the detector to the incoming scattered field.
        - \( \Psi_{scat} \): The scattered field produced by the scatterer.
        - \( \Omega \): The solid angle over which the integration is performed, typically covering the full \( 4\pi \) steradians around the scatterer.
        - \( d\Omega \): The differential solid angle element.

        This integral computes the overlap between the detector's sensitivity pattern and the scattered field, which is then squared to represent the power coupled into the detector.

        Parameters
        ----------
        scatterer : BaseScatterer
            The scatterer object that interacts with the incident light, producing the scattered field.

        Returns
        -------
        Quantity
            The power coupling between the detector and the scatterer, expressed in watts (W). This value represents the amount of scattered power that is captured by the detector.

        Notes
        -----
        - The method internally invokes the appropriate binding method based on the type of scatterer (e.g., Sphere, Cylinder) to calculate the coupling.
        - The coupling depends on both the geometry of the detector and the nature of the scattered field, making it essential for evaluating the efficiency of light collection in scattering experiments.

        Example
        -------
        A common use case is to evaluate how much of the scattered light from a nanoparticle is captured by a photodiode or integrating sphere. The result can be used to estimate the efficiency of light collection for scattering measurements.

        r"""
        Compute the Poynting vector norm, representing the energy flux density of the electromagnetic field.

        The Poynting vector describes the directional energy transfer per unit area for an electromagnetic wave. It is defined as:

        .. math::
            \vec{S} = \epsilon_0 c^2 \, \vec{E} \times \vec{B}

        Where:

        - \( \vec{E} \): Electric field vector (V/m)
        - \( \vec{B} \): Magnetic field vector (T)

        The cross product of the electric and magnetic field vectors results in the Poynting vector, which represents the flow of electromagnetic energy in space.

        Parameters
        ----------

        The Poynting vector is computed over a 3D mesh of voxels that cover the entire solid angle of \( 4\pi \) steradians. This method calculates the local energy flux at each voxel and returns the norm, which represents the magnitude of energy flow at each point in space around the scatterer.

        The Poynting vector is fundamental in understanding how energy is transmitted through space in the form of electromagnetic waves.

        Example
        -------
        This method is used to assess the distribution of energy around a scatterer. The total energy flow can be obtained by integrating the Poynting vector over the surface enclosing the scatterer.
