Extra Examples
==============

This gallery gathers additional examples of PyMieSim usage.  They illustrate more
specialised setups such as coupling efficiency heatmaps or system visualisation.

Contents
--------
- ``SphereProperties.py`` – compute optical properties for a range of sphere sizes.
- ``plot_coupling_heatmap.py`` – visualise coupling as a function of NA and refractive index.
- ``plot_system.py`` – draw the arrangement of sources, detectors and scatterers.
- ``plot_Qsca_vs_permittivity_vs_size_parameter.py`` – inspect scattering as material and size vary.
