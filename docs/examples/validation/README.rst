Validation Examples
===================

This section compares PyMieSim's results against reference implementations.  It
contains scripts reproducing calculations from Bohren & Huffman as well as
cross-checks with the ``PyMieScatt`` package.  Internal tests that exercise
specific parts of the library are also provided.

Contents
--------
- ``bohren_huffman`` - examples based on figures from *Absorption and Scattering of Light by Small Particles*.
- ``pymiescatt`` - comparisons with the ``PyMieScatt`` package.
- ``internal`` - small utilities checking phase functions and energy flow.
